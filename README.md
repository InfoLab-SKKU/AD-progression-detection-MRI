## Alzheimer disease progression detection from longitudional MRI
This is the Pytorch implementation of the paper "Alzheimerâ€™s disease progression detection based on multimodal deep learning model and visual explainability of time series data". 

## Prerequisites:
* [Python3](https://www.python.org/)
* [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)
* [NiBabel](https://nipy.org/nibabel/)

## Data:
Please save the MRI ".npy" data into CN and AD folders, respectively. You can use the "data preprocessing/Baseline_volumes.py" for the baseline or "data preprocessing/BaselineMRI+M06MRI_volumes(two_timesteps).py" or BaselineMRI+M06MRI+M12MRI_volumes(three_timesteps).py" to prepare the data for multiple timesteps accordingly.

## Training-Testing:
After data preparation, any model (Proposed network, 3DVGG, 3DResNet) with any data combination can be trained and test with the provided code. Such as code for traininig-testing  proposed network with the baseline MRI data can be found in directory "ProposedNet/ProposedNet_at_BaselineMRI.py".
